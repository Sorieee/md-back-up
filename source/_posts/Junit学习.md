# Jump start

*  Each unit test should run independently of all other unit tests.
* The framework should detect and report errors test by test
* It should be easy to define which unit tests will run.

The team has defined three discrete goals for the framework:

* The framework must help us write useful tests.
* The framework must help us create tests that retain their value over time.
* The framework must help us lower the cost of writing tests by reusing code.



â€‹	The dependencies that are always needed in the pom.xml file are shown in the following listing. In the beginning, you need only`junit-jupiter-api` and `junit-jupiter-engine`.

```xml
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
     <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
     <version>5.6.0</version>
     <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
     <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
     <version>5.6.0</version>
     <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<build>
    <plugins>
         <plugin>
             <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
             <version>2.22.2</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

## Testing with JUnit

* Separate test class instances and class loaders for each unit test to prevent side effects
* JUnit annotations to provide resource initialization and cleanup methods: `@BeforeEach`, `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterEach`, and`@AfterAll` (starting from version 5); and `@Before`,`@BeforeClass`, `@After`, and `@AfterClass` (up to version 4)
* A variety of assert methods that make it easy to check the results of your tests
* Integration with popular tools such as Maven and Gradle, as well as popular integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ

```java
public class CalculatorTest {

    @Test
    public void testAdd() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        double result = calculator.add(10, 50);
        assertEquals(60, result, 0);
    }
}
```

â€‹	JUnit 3 required extending the `TestCase` class, but this requirement was removed with JUnit 4. Also, up to JUnit 4, the class had to be public; starting with version 5, the test class can be public or private, and you can name it whatever you want.

â€‹	`delta` provides a range factor: if the actual value is within the range`expected - delta` and `expected + delta`, the test will pass. 

# Exploring Core Unit

* *A test class* may be a top-level class, static member class, or an inner class annotated as `@Nested` that contains one or more test methods. Test classes cannot be abstract and must have a single constructor. The constructor must have no arguments or arguments that can be dynamically resolved at runtime through dependency injection. (We discuss the details of dependency injection in section 2.6.) A test class is allowed to be package-private as a minimum requirement for visibility. It is no longer required that test classes be public, as was the case up to JUnit 4.x. In our example, because we do not define any other constructors, we do not need to define the no-arguments constructor; the Java compiler will supply a no-args constructor.
* *A test method* is an instance method that is annotated with `@Test`, `@RepeatedTest`, `@ParameterizedTest`,`@TestFactory`, or `@TestTemplate`.
* *A life cycle method* is a method that is annotated with `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterAll`, `@BeforeEach`, or `@AfterEach`



â€‹	Test methods must not be abstract and must not return a value (the return type should be void).

â€‹	If you annotate your test class with `@TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)`, JUnit 5 will execute all test methods on the same test instance. A new test instance will be created for each test class when using this annotation.

â€‹	Listing 2.3 shows the use of the JUnit 5 life cycle methods in the `lifecycle.SUTTest` class.

```java
class SUTTest {
    private static ResourceForAllTests resourceForAllTests;
    private SUT systemUnderTest;

    @BeforeAll
    static void setUpClass() {
        resourceForAllTests = new ResourceForAllTests("Our resource for all tests");
    }

    @AfterAll
    static void tearDownClass() {
        resourceForAllTests.close();
    }

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        systemUnderTest = new SUT("Our system under test");
    }

    @AfterEach
    void tearDown() {
        systemUnderTest.close();
    }

    @Test
    void testRegularWork() {
        boolean canReceiveRegularWork = systemUnderTest.canReceiveRegularWork();

        assertTrue(canReceiveRegularWork);
    }

    @Test
    void testAdditionalWork() {
        boolean canReceiveAdditionalWork = systemUnderTest.canReceiveAdditionalWork();

        assertFalse(canReceiveAdditionalWork);
    }
}
```

```
	Our resource for all tests from class ResourceForAllTests is initializing.

    Our system under test from class SUT is initializing.
    Our system under test from class SUT can receive regular work.
    Our system under test from class SUT is closing.


    Our system under test from class SUT is initializing.
    Our system under test from class SUT cannot receive additional work.
    Our system under test from class SUT is closing.

    Our resource for all tests from class ResourceForAllTests is closing.
    Disconnected from the target VM, address: '127.0.0.1:57960', transport: 'socket'

    Process finished with exit code 0
```

* The method annotated with `@BeforeAll` #1 is executed once: before all tests. This method needs to be static unless the whole test class is annotated with `@TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)`.
* The method annotated with `@BeforeEach` #3 is executed before each test. In our case, it will be executed twice.
* The two methods annotated with `@Test` #5 are executed independently.
* The method annotated with `@AfterEach` #4 is executed after each test. In our case, it will be executed twice.
* The method annotated with `@AfterAll` #2 is executed once: after all tests. This method needs to be static unless the whole test class is annotated with `@TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)`.
*  In order to run this test class, you can execute from the command line: `mvn -Dtest=SUTTest.java clean install`

## **The @DisplayName annotation**

â€‹	The `@DisplayName` annotation can be used over classes and test methods. It helps the engineers at Tested Data Systems declare their own display name for an annotated test class or test method.

```java
class DisplayNameTest {
    private SUT systemUnderTest = new SUT();

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Our system under test says hello.")
    void testHello() {
        assertEquals("Hello", systemUnderTest.hello());
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("ðŸ˜±")
    void testTalking() {
        assertEquals("How are you?", systemUnderTest.talk());
    }

    @Test
    void testBye() {
        assertEquals("Bye", systemUnderTest.bye());
    }
}
```

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/610f45f45132923bf8c20fe2.jpg)

### The @Disabled annotation

```java
@Disabled("Feature is still under construction.")
class DisabledClassTest {
}

	@Test
    @Disabled("Feature still under construction.")
    void testAdditionalWork() {
        boolean canReceiveAdditionalWork = systemUnderTest.canReceiveAdditionalWork();

        assertFalse(canReceiveAdditionalWork);
    }
```

## Nested tests

```java
public class NestedTestsTest {
    private static final String FIRST_NAME = "John";
    private static final String LAST_NAME = "Smith";

    @Nested
    class BuilderTest {
        private String MIDDLE_NAME = "Michael";

        @Test
        void customerBuilder() throws ParseException {
            SimpleDateFormat simpleDateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("MM-dd-yyyy");
            Date customerDate = simpleDateFormat.parse("04-21-2019");

            Customer customer = new Customer.Builder(Gender.MALE, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME)
                    .withMiddleName(MIDDLE_NAME)
                    .withBecomeCustomer(customerDate)
                    .build();


            assertAll(() -> {
                assertEquals(Gender.MALE, customer.getGender());
                assertEquals(FIRST_NAME, customer.getFirstName());
                assertEquals(LAST_NAME, customer.getLastName());
                assertEquals(MIDDLE_NAME, customer.getMiddleName());
                assertEquals(customerDate, customer.getBecomeCustomer());
            });
        }
    }
}
```

## Tagged tests

â€‹	If you are familiar with JUnit 4, *tagged tests* are replacements for JUnit 4 categories. You can use the `@Tag` annotation over classes and test methods. Later, you can use tags to filter test discovery and execution.

```java
@Tag("individual")
public class CustomerTest {
    private String CUSTOMER_NAME = "John Smith";

    @Test
    void testCustomer() {
        Customer customer = new Customer(CUSTOMER_NAME);

        assertEquals("John Smith", customer.getName());
    }
}
```

```java
@Tag("repository")
public class CustomersRepositoryTest {
    private String CUSTOMER_NAME = "John Smith";
    private CustomersRepository repository = new CustomersRepository();

    @Test
    void testNonExistence() {
        boolean exists = repository.contains("John Smith");

        assertFalse(exists);
    }

    @Test
    void testCustomerPersistence() {
        repository.persist(new Customer(CUSTOMER_NAME));

        assertTrue(repository.contains("John Smith"));
    }
}
```

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/610f47ba5132923bf8c43c2e.jpg)

â€‹	To activate the tags, you have a few alternatives. One is to work at the level of the pom.xml configuration file. In this example, itâ€™s enough to uncomment the configuration node of the Surefire plugin #1 and run `mvn clean install`.

â€‹	Another alternative in the IntelliJ IDEA IDE is to activate the tags by creating a configuration by choosing Run > Runâ€¦ > Edit Configurations > Tags (JUnit 5) as the test kind (figure 2.2). This is fine when you would like to quickly make some changes about which tests to run locally. However, it is strongly recommended that you make the changes at the level of the pom.xml fileâ€”otherwise, any automated build of the project will fail.

## Assertions

| assert method                                    | What is it used for                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| assertAll                                        | Overloaded method. It asserts that none of the supplied executables throw exceptions. An executable is an object of type org.junit.jupiter.api.function.Executable. |
| assertArrayEquals                                | Overloaded method. It asserts that the expected array and the actual array are equal. |
| assertEquals                                     | Overloaded method. It asserts that the expected values and the actual values are equal. |
| assert*X*(..., String message)                   | Assertion that delivers the supplied message to the test framework if the assertion fails |
| assert*X*(..., Supplier<String> messageSupplier) | Assertion that delivers the supplied message to the test framework if the assertion fails. The failure message will be retrieved lazily from the supplied messageSupplier. |

â€‹	JUnit 5 provides a lot of overloaded assertion methods. It takes many assertion methods from JUnit 4 and adds a few that can use Java 8 lambdas. All JUnit Jupiter assertions belong to the `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` class and are static methods. 



**assertAll**

```java
class AssertAllTest {
    @Test
    @DisplayName("SUT should default to not being under current verification")
    void testSystemNotVerified() {
        SUT systemUnderTest = new SUT("Our system under test");

        assertAll("By default, SUT is not under current verification",
                () -> assertEquals("Our system under test", systemUnderTest.getSystemName()),
                () -> assertFalse(systemUnderTest.isVerified())
        );
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("SUT should be under current verification")
    void testSystemUnderVerification() {
        SUT systemUnderTest = new SUT("Our system under test");

        systemUnderTest.verify();

        assertAll("SUT should be under current verification",
                () -> assertEquals("Our system under test", systemUnderTest.getSystemName()),
                () -> assertTrue(systemUnderTest.isVerified())
        );
    }
}
```

â€‹	The `assertAll` method will always check all the assertions that are provided to it, even if some of them failâ€”if any of the executables fail, the remaining ones will still be run. 

**Some assertion methods with messages**

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/610f49215132923bf8c5f892.jpg)



* A condition is verified with the help of the `assertTrue` method #1. In case of failure, a message is lazily created #2.
* A condition is verified with the help of the `assertFalse` method #3. In case of failure, a message is lazily created #4.
* The existence of an object is verified with the help of the `assertNull` method #5. In case of failure, a message is lazily created #6.

**Some assertTimeout methods**

```java
class AssertTimeoutTest {
    private SUT systemUnderTest = new SUT("Our system under test");

    @Test
    @DisplayName("A job is executed within a timeout")
    void testTimeout() throws InterruptedException {
        systemUnderTest.addJob(new Job("Job 1"));
        assertTimeout(ofMillis(500), () -> systemUnderTest.run(200));
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("A job is executed preemptively within a timeout")
    void testTimeoutPreemptively() throws InterruptedException {
        systemUnderTest.addJob(new Job("Job 1"));
        assertTimeoutPreemptively(ofMillis(500), () -> systemUnderTest.run(200));
    }
```

â€‹	`assertTimeout` waits until the executable finishes #1. The failure message looks something like this: `execution exceeded timeout of 500 ms by 193 ms`.

â€‹	`assertTimeoutPreemptively` stops the executable when the time has expired #2). The failure message looks like this:`execution timed out after 100 ms`.

**Some assertThrows methods**

```java
class AssertThrowsTest {
    private SUT systemUnderTest = new SUT("Our system under test");

    @Test
    @DisplayName("An exception is expected")
    void testExpectedException() {
        assertThrows(NoJobException.class, systemUnderTest::run);
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("An exception is caught")
    void testCatchException() {
        Throwable throwable = assertThrows(NoJobException.class, () -> systemUnderTest.run(1000));

        assertEquals("No jobs on the execution list!", throwable.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this example:

*  We verify that the `systemUnderTest` objectâ€™s call of the `run` method throws a `NoJobException` #1.
* We verify that a call to `systemUnderTest.run(1000)` throws a `NoJobException`, and we keep a reference to the thrown exception in the `throwable` variable #2.
* We check the message kept in the `throwable` exception variable #3.

## Assumptions

â€‹	Sometimes tests fail due to an external environment configuration or a date or time zone issue that we cannot control. We can prevent our tests from being executed under inappropriate conditions.

â€‹	JUnit 5 comes with a set of assumption methods suitable for use with Java 8 lambdas. The JUnit 5 assumptions are static methods belonging to the `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions` class. The `message` parameter is in the last position.

**Some assumption methods**

```java
class AssumptionsTest {
    private static String EXPECTED_JAVA_VERSION = "1.8";
    private TestsEnvironment environment = new TestsEnvironment(
            new JavaSpecification(System.getProperty("java.vm.specification.version")),
            new OperationSystem(System.getProperty("os.name"), System.getProperty("os.arch"))
    );

    private SUT systemUnderTest = new SUT();

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        assumeTrue(environment.isWindows());
    }

    @Test
    void testNoJobToRun() {
        assumingThat(
                () -> environment.getJavaVersion().equals(EXPECTED_JAVA_VERSION),
                () -> assertFalse(systemUnderTest.hasJobToRun()));
    }

    @Test
    void testJobToRun() {
        assumeTrue(environment.isAmd64Architecture());

        systemUnderTest.run(new Job());

        assertTrue(systemUnderTest.hasJobToRun());
    }
}
```

* The `@BeforeEach` annotated method is executed before each test. The test will not run unless the assumption that the current environment is Windows is true #1.
* The first test checks that the current Java version is the expected one #2. Only if this assumption is true does it verify that no job is currently being run by the SUT #3.)
* The second test checks the current environment architecture #4. Only if this architecture is the expected one does it run a new job on the SUT #5 and verify that the system has a job to run #6.

## Dependency injection in JUnit 5

â€‹	The previous JUnit versions did not permit test constructors or methods to have parameters. JUnit 5 allows test constructors and methods to have parameters, but they need to be resolved through dependency injection.

**TestInfoParameterResolver**

```java
class TestInfoTest {

    TestInfoTest(TestInfo testInfo) {
        assertEquals("TestInfoTest", testInfo.getDisplayName());
    }

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp(TestInfo testInfo) {
        String displayName = testInfo.getDisplayName();
        assertTrue(displayName.equals("display name of the method") || displayName.equals("testGetNameOfTheMethod(TestInfo)"));
    }

    @Test
    void testGetNameOfTheMethod(TestInfo testInfo) {
        assertEquals("testGetNameOfTheMethod(TestInfo)", testInfo.getDisplayName());
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("display name of the method")
    void testGetNameOfTheMethodWithDisplayNameAnnotation(TestInfo testInfo) {
        assertEquals("display name of the method", testInfo.getDisplayName());
    }
}
```

* A `TestInfo` parameter is injected into the constructor and into three methods. The constructor verifies that the display name is `TestInfoTest`: its own name #1. This behavior is the default behavior, which we can vary using `@DisplayName`annotations.
* The `@BeforeEach` annotated method is executed before each test. It has an injected `TestInfo` parameter, and it verifies that the displayed name is the expected one: the name of the method or the name specified by the `@DisplayName`annotation #2.
*  Both tests have an injected `TestInfo` parameter. Each parameter verifies that the displayed name is the expected one: the name of the method in the first test #3 or the name specified by the `@DisplayName` annotation in the second test #4.
* The built-in `TestInfoParameterResolver` supplies an instance of `TestInfo` that corresponds to the current container or test as the value of the expected parameters of the constructor and of the methods.

**TestReporterParameterResolver**

```java
class TestReporterTest {

    @Test
    void testReportSingleValue(TestReporter testReporter) {
        testReporter.publishEntry("Single value");
    }

    @Test
    void testReportKeyValuePair(TestReporter testReporter) {
        testReporter.publishEntry("Key", "Value");
    }

    @Test
    void testReportMultipleKeyValuePairs(TestReporter testReporter) {
        Map<String, String> values = new HashMap<>();
        values.put("user", "John");
        values.put("password", "secret");

        testReporter.publishEntry(values);
    }
}
```

* In the first method, it is used to publish a single value entry 1).
*  In the second method, it is used to publish a key-value pair #2.
* In the third method, we construct a map #3, populate it with two key-value pairs #4, and then use it to publish the constructed map #5.
* The built-in `TestReporterParameterResolver` supplies the instance of `TestReporter` needed to publish the entries.

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/610f69c05132923bf8f1a411.jpg)

**RepetitionInfoParameterResolve**r

â€‹	If a parameter in a method annotated with `@RepeatedTest`, `@BeforeEach`, or `@AfterEach` is of type `RepetitionInfo`,`RepetitionInfoParameterResolver` supplies an instance of this type`.` Then `RepetitionInfo` gets information about the current repetition and the total number of repetitions for a test annotated with `@RepeatedTest`. Repeated tests and examples are discussed in the following section.

## Repeated tests

* `{displayName}`â€”Display name of the method annotated with `@RepeatedTest`
* `{currentRepetition}`â€”Current repetition number
* `{totalRepetitions}`â€”Total number of repetitions

```java
public class RepeatedTestsTest {

    private static Set<Integer> integerSet = new HashSet<>();
    private static List<Integer> integerList = new ArrayList<>();

    @RepeatedTest(value = 5, name = "{displayName} - repetition {currentRepetition}/{totalRepetitions}")
    @DisplayName("Test add operation")
    void addNumber() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        assertEquals(2, calculator.add(1, 1), "1 + 1 should equal 2");
    }

    @RepeatedTest(value = 5, name = "the list contains {currentRepetition} elements(s), the set contains 1 element")
    void testAddingToCollections(TestReporter testReporter, RepetitionInfo repetitionInfo) {
        integerSet.add(1);
        integerList.add(repetitionInfo.getCurrentRepetition());

        testReporter.publishEntry("Repetition number", String.valueOf(repetitionInfo.getCurrentRepetition()));
        assertEquals(1, integerSet.size());
        assertEquals(repetitionInfo.getCurrentRepetition(), integerList.size());
    }
}
```

## Parameterized tests

â€‹	`@ValueSource` lets us specify a single array of literal values. At execution, this array provides a single argument for each invocation of the parameterized test. The following test checks the number of words in some phrases that are provided as parameters.

```java
class ParameterizedWithValueSourceTest {
    private WordCounter wordCounter = new WordCounter();

    @ParameterizedTest
    @ValueSource(strings = {"Check three parameters", "JUnit in Action"})
    void testWordsInSentence(String sentence) {
        assertEquals(3, wordCounter.countWords(sentence));
    }
}
```

â€‹	`@EnumSource` enables us to use `enum` instances. The annotation provides an optional `names` parameter that lets us specify which instances must be used or excluded. By default, all instances of an `enum` are used.

```java
class ParameterizedWithEnumSourceTest {
    private WordCounter wordCounter = new WordCounter();

    @ParameterizedTest
    @EnumSource(Sentences.class)
    void testWordsInSentence(Sentences sentence) {
        assertEquals(3, wordCounter.countWords(sentence.value()));
    }

    @ParameterizedTest
    @EnumSource(value = Sentences.class, names = {"JUNIT_IN_ACTION", "THREE_PARAMETERS"})
    void testSelectedWordsInSentence(Sentences sentence) {
        assertEquals(3, wordCounter.countWords(sentence.value()));
    }

    @ParameterizedTest
    @EnumSource(value = Sentences.class, mode = EXCLUDE, names = {"THREE_PARAMETERS"})
    void testExcludedWordsInSentence(Sentences sentence) {
        assertEquals(3, wordCounter.countWords(sentence.value()));
    }

    enum Sentences {
        JUNIT_IN_ACTION("JUnit in Action"),
        SOME_PARAMETERS("Check some parameters"),
        THREE_PARAMETERS("Check three parameters");

        private final String sentence;

        Sentences(String sentence) {
            this.sentence = sentence;
        }

        public String value() {
            return sentence;
        }
    }
}
```

**@CsvSource annotation**

```java
class ParameterizedWithCsvSourceTest {
    private WordCounter wordCounter = new WordCounter();

    @ParameterizedTest
    @CsvSource({"2, Unit testing", "3, JUnit in Action", "4, Write solid Java code"})
    void testWordsInSentence(int expected, String sentence) {
        assertEquals(expected, wordCounter.countWords(sentence));
    }
}
```

**@CsvFileSource annotation**

```java
class ParameterizedWithCsvFileSourceTest {
    private WordCounter wordCounter = new WordCounter();

    @ParameterizedTest
    @CsvFileSource(resources = "/word_counter.csv")
    void testWordsInSentence(int expected, String sentence) {
        assertEquals(expected, wordCounter.countWords(sentence));
    }
}
```

```
2, Unit testing
3, JUnit in Action
4, Write solid Java code
```

## Dynamic tests

â€‹	JUnit 5 introduces a dynamic new programming model that can generate tests at runtime. We write a factory method, and at runtime, it creates a series of tests to be executed. Such a factory method must be annotated with `@TestFactory`.

â€‹	A `@TestFactory` method is not a regular test but a factory that generates tests. A method annotated as `@TestFactory` must return one of the following:

* A `DynamicNode` (an abstract class; `DynamicContainer` and `DynamicTest` are the instantiable concrete classes)
* An array of `DynamicNode` objects
* A `Stream` of `DynamicNode` objects
* A `Collection` of `DynamicNode` objects
* An `Iterable` of `DynamicNode` objects
* An `Iterator` of `DynamicNode` objects

```java
class DynamicTestsTest {

    private PositiveNumberPredicate predicate = new PositiveNumberPredicate();

    @BeforeAll
    static void setUpClass() {
        System.out.println("@BeforeAll method");
    }

## Using Hamcrest matchers

â€‹	Statistics show that people easily become hooked on the unit-testing philosophy. When we get accustomed to writing tests and see how good it feels to be protected from possible mistakes, we wonder how it was possible to live without unit testing.

**Cumbersome JUnit assert method**

```java
public class HamcrestListTest {

    private List<String> values;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        values = new ArrayList<>();
        values.add("John");
        values.add("Michael");
        values.add("Edwin");
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("List without Hamcrest will intentionally fail to show how failing information is displayed")
    public void testListWithoutHamcrest() {
        assertEquals(3, values.size());
        assertTrue(values.contains("Oliver") || values.contains("Jack") || values.contains("Harry"));
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("List with Hamcrest will intentionally fail to show how failing information is displayed")
    public void testListWithHamcrest() {
        assertThat(values, hasSize(3));
        assertThat(values, hasItem(anyOf(equalTo("Oliver"), equalTo("Jack"),
                equalTo("Harry"))));
        assertThat("The list doesn't contain all the expected objects, in order", values, contains("Oliver", "Jack", "Harry"));
        assertThat("The list doesn't contain all the expected objects", values, containsInAnyOrder("Jack", "Harry", "Oliver"));
    }
}
```

â€‹	To solve this problem, Tested Data Systems uses a library of matchers for building test expressions: Hamcrest. Hamcrest ([https://code.google.com/archive/p/hamcrest](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hamcrest/)) is a library that contains a lot of helpful *matcher* objects (also known as *constraints* or *predicates*) ported in several languages, such as Java, C++, Objective-C, Python, and PHP.

```java
public class HamcrestMatchersTest {

    private static String FIRST_NAME = "John";
    private static String LAST_NAME = "Smith";
    private static Customer customer = new Customer(FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME);


    @Test
    @DisplayName("Hamcrest is, anyOf, allOf")
    public void testHamcrestIs() {
        int price1 = 1, price2 = 1, price3 = 2;

        assertThat(1, is(price1));
        assertThat(1, anyOf(is(price2), is(price3)));
        assertThat(1, allOf(is(price1), is(price2)));
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Null expected")
    void testNull() {
        assertThat(null, nullValue());
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Object expected")
    void testNotNull() {
        assertThat(customer, notNullValue());
    }

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Check correct customer properties")
    void checkCorrectCustomerProperties() {
        assertThat(customer, allOf(
                hasProperty("firstName", is(FIRST_NAME)),
                hasProperty("lastName", is(LAST_NAME))
        ));
    }

}
```

To use Hamcrest in our projects, we need to add the required dependency to the pom.xml file.

```java
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hamcrest</groupId>
    <artifactId>hamcrest-library</artifactId>
    <version>2.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

â€‹	To use Hamcrest in JUnit 4, you have to use the `assertThat` method from the `org.junit.Assert` class. But as explained earlier in this chapter, JUnit 5 removes the `assertThat()` method. The user guide justifies the decision this way:

**Sample of common Hamcrest static factory methods**

| Factory method                                               | Logical                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| anything                                                     | Matches to absolutely anything. Useful in some cases where you want to make the assert statement more readable. |
| is                                                           | This matcher is used only to improve the readability of your statements. |
| allOf                                                        | A matcher that checks if all contained matchers match (just like the && operator). |
| anyOf                                                        | A matcher that checks if any of the contained matchers match (like the operator \|\|). |
| not                                                          | A matcher that inverses the meaning of the contained matchers (just like the ! operator in Java). |
| instanceOf                                                   | A matchers that matches whether objects are instance of one another. |
| sameInstance                                                 | A matcher to test object identity.                           |
| nullValue , notNullValue                                     | A matcher to test for null values (or non-null values).      |
| hasProperty                                                  | A matcher to test whether a Java Bean has a certain property. |
| hasEntry, hasKey, hasValue                                   | This matcher tests whether a given Map has a given entry, key or value. |
| hasItem, hasItems                                            | This matchers tests a given collection for presence of item or items. |
| closeTo, greaterThan, greaterThanOrEqual, lessThan, lessThanOrEqual | Test given numbers are close to, greater than, greater than or equal, less than or less than or equal to a given value. |
| equalToIgnoringCase                                          | Tests a given string equals another one, ignoring the case.  |
| equalToIgnoringWhiteSpace                                    | Tests a given string equals another one, by ignoring the white spaces. |
| containsString, endsWith, startWith                          | Tests whether the given string contains, starts with or ends with a certain string. |

# JUnit architecture

* Demonstrating the concept and importance of software architecture
* Comparing the JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 architectures

## The concept and importance of software architecture

Junit5 vs Junit4

* smaller works better.
* modularity improves the work. 

## JUnit 4 architecture

**JUnit 4 modularity**

â€‹	If a programmer wants to use JUnit 4 in a project, all they need to do is add that JAR file on the classpath.

**JUnit 4 runners**

â€‹	A JUnit 4 *runner* is a class that extends the JUnit 4 abstract `Runner` class. A JUnit 4 runner is responsible for running JUnit tests. JUnit 4 remains a single JAR file, but itâ€™s generally necessary to extend the functionality of this file. In other words, developers have the opportunity to add custom features to the functionality, such as executing additional things before and after running a test.

**JUnit 4 rules**

â€‹	A JUnit 4 *rule* is a component that intercepts test method calls; it allows us to do something before a test method is run and something else after a test method has run. Rules are specific to JUnit 4.

```java
public class Calculator {
    public double add(double number1, double number2) {
        return number1 + number2;
    }

    public double sqrt(double x) {
        if (x < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot extract the square root of a negative value");
        }
        return Math.sqrt(x);
    }

    public double divide(double x, double y) {
        if (y == 0) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Cannot divide by zero");
        }
        return x / y;
    }
}
```

â€‹	Listing 3.5 specifies which exception message is expected during the execution of the test code, using the new functionality of the `Calculator` class.

```java
public class RuleExceptionTester {
    @Rule
    public ExpectedException expectedException = ExpectedException.none();

    private Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

    @Test
    public void expectIllegalArgumentException() {
        expectedException.expect(IllegalArgumentException.class);
        expectedException.expectMessage("Cannot extract the square root of a negative value");
        calculator.sqrt(-1);
    }

    @Test
    public void expectArithmeticException() {
        expectedException.expect(ArithmeticException.class);
        expectedException.expectMessage("Cannot divide by zero");
        calculator.divide(1, 0);
    }
}
```

* We declare an `ExpectedException` field annotated with `@Rule`. The `@Rule` annotation must be applied to a public nonstatic field or a public nonstatic method (#A). The `ExpectedException.none()` factory method simply creates an unconfigured `ExpectedException`.
* We initialize an instance of the `Calculator` class whose functionality we are testing (#B).
* The `ExpectedException` is configured to keep the type of exception (#C) and message (#D) before it is thrown by invoking the `sqrt` method (#E).
* he `ExpectedException` is configured to keep the type of exception (#F) and message #G before it is thrown by invoking the `divide` method (#H).

**The RuleTester class**

```
public class RuleTester {
    @Rule
    public TemporaryFolder folder = new TemporaryFolder();
    private static File createdFolder;
    private static File createdFile;

    @Test
    public void testTemporaryFolder() throws IOException {
        createdFolder = folder.newFolder("createdFolder");
        createdFile = folder.newFile("createdFile.txt");
        assertTrue(createdFolder.exists());
        assertTrue(createdFile.exists());
    }

    @AfterClass
    public static void cleanUpAfterAllTestsRan() {
        assertFalse(createdFolder.exists());
        assertFalse(createdFile.exists());
    }
}
```

* We declare a `TemporaryFolder` field annotated with `@Rule` and initialize it. The `@Rule` annotation must be applied to a public field or a public method (#A).
*  We declare the static fields `createdFolder` and `createdFile` #B.
* We use the `TemporaryFolder` field to create a folder and a file (#C), which are located in the `Temp` folder of our user profile in the operating system.
* We check the existence of the temporary folder and of the temporary file (#D).
* At the end of the execution of the tests, we check that the temporary resources do not exist any longer (#E).



â€‹	To write our own custom rule, weâ€™ll have to create a class that implements the `TestRule` interface. Consequently, weâ€™ll override the `apply(Statement, Description)` method, which must return an instance of `Statement`. Such an object represents the tests within the JUnit run time, and `Statement#evaluate()` runs them. The `Description` object describes the individual test; we can use this object to read information about the test through reflection.

```java
public class CustomRule implements TestRule {
    private Statement base;
    private Description description;

    @Override
    public Statement apply(Statement base, Description description) {
        this.base = base;
        this.description = description;
        return new CustomStatement(base, description);
    }
}
```

*  We declare a `CustomRule` class that implements the `TestRule` interface (#A).
* We keep references to a `Statement` field and to a `Description` field (#B), and we use them into the `apply` method that returns a `CustomStatement` (#C).



```java
public class CustomStatement extends Statement {
    private Statement base;
    private Description description;

    public CustomStatement(Statement base, Description description) {
        this.base = base;
        this.description = description;
    }

    @Override
    public void evaluate() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println(this.getClass().getSimpleName() + " " + description.getMethodName() + " has started");
        try {
            base.evaluate();
        } finally {
            System.out.println(this.getClass().getSimpleName() + " " + description.getMethodName() + " has finished");
        }
    }
}
```

* We declare our `CustomStatement` class that extends the `Statement` class (#A).
* We keep references to a `Statement` field and a `Description` field (#B), and we use them as arguments of the constructor (#C).
* We override the inherited `evaluate` method and call `base.evaluate()` inside it (#D).

```java
public class CustomRuleTester {

    @Rule
    public CustomRule myRule = new CustomRule();

    @Test
    public void myCustomRuleTest() {
        System.out.println("Call of a test method");
    }
}
```

* We declare a public `CustomRule` field and annotate it with `@Rule` (#A).
* We create the `myCustomRuleTest` method and annotate it with `@Test` (#B).

**CustomRuleTester2**

```java
public class CustomRuleTester2 {

    private CustomRule myRule = new CustomRule();

    @Rule
    public CustomRule getMyRule() {
        return myRule;
    }

    @Test
    public void myCustomRuleTest() {
        System.out.println("Call of a test method");
    }
}
```

```xml
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.junit.vintage</groupId>
		<artifactId>junit-vintage-engine</artifactId>
		<version>5.6.0</version>
		<scope>provided</scope>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**Shortcomings of the JUnit 4 architecture**

* The API provided by JUnit 4 was not flexible enough.

## JUnit 5 architecture

**JUnit 5 modularity**

â€‹	The architecture had to allow JUnit to interact with different programmatic clients that used different tools and IDEs. The logical separation of concerns required

* An API to write tests, dedicated mainly to developers
* A mechanism for discovering and running the tests
* An API to allow easy interaction with IDEs and tools and to run the tests from them



â€‹	As a consequence, the JUnit 5 architecture contained three modules (figure 3.7):

* *JUnit Platform*, which serves as a foundation for launching testing frameworks on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It also provides an API to launch tests from the console, IDEs, or build tools.
* *JUnit Jupiter*, the combination of the new programming and extension model for writing tests and extensions in JUnit 5. The name comes from the fifth planet of our solar system, which is also the largest.
* *JUnit Vintage*, a test engine for running JUnit 3- and JUnit 4-based tests on the platform, ensuring backward compatibility.

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/6110f8765132923bf8123b0e.jpg)

**JUnit 5 platform**

* `junit-platform-commons`, an internal common library of JUnit intended solely for use within the JUnit framework. Any use by external parties is not supported.
* `junit-platform-console`, which provides support for discovering and executing tests on the JUnit Platform from the console.
* `junit-platform-console-standalone`, an executable JAR with all dependencies included. This artifact is used by Console Launcher, a command-line Java application that lets us launch the JUnit Platform from the console. It can be used to run JUnit Vintage and JUnit Jupiter tests, for example, and to print test execution results to the console.
* `junit-platform-engine`, a public API for test engines.
* `junit-platform-launcher`, a public API for configuring and launching test plans; typically used by IDEs and build tools.
* `junit-platform-runner`, a runner for executing tests and test suites on the JUnit Platform in a JUnit 4 environment.
* `junit-platform-suite-api`, which contains the annotations for configuring test suites on the JUnit Platform.
* `junit-platform-surefire-`provider, which provides support for discovering and executing tests on the JUnit Platform by using Maven Surefire.
* `junit-platform-gradle-plugin`, which provides support for discovering and executing tests on the JUnit Platform by using Gradle.



**JUnit 5 Jupiter**

â€‹	JUnit Jupiter is the combination of the new programming (annotations, classes, and methods) and extension model for writing tests and extensions in JUnit 5. 

* `junit-jupiter-api`, the JUnit Jupiter API for writing tests and extensions
* `junit-jupiter-engine`, the JUnit Jupiter test engine implementation, required only at run time
* `junit-jupiter-params`, which provides support for parameterized tests in JUnit Jupiter
* `junit-jupiter-migrationsupport`, which provides migration support from JUnit 4 to JUnit Jupiter and is required only for running selected JUnit 4 rules

**JUnit 5 Vintage**

â€‹	JUnit Vintage provides a `TestEngine` for running JUnit 3- and JUnit 4-based tests on the platform. JUnit 5 Vintage contains only`junit-vintage-engine`, the engine implementation to execute tests written in JUnit 3 or 4. For this purpose, of course, we also need the JUnit 3 or 4 JARs.

**The big picture of the JUnit 5 architecture**

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/6110f9b85132923bf814edb8.jpg)

â€‹	Detailing at the level of the jar files (figure 3.9):

* The test APIs provide the facilities for different test engines: `junit-jupiter-api` for JUnit 5 tests, `junit-4.12` for legacy tests, and custom engines for third-party tests.
*  The test engines mentioned earlier are created by extending the `junit-platform-engine` public API, which is part of the JUnit 5 Platform.
* The `junit-platform-launcher` public API provides the facilities to discover tests inside the JUnit 5 Platform for build tools such as Maven or Gradle or for IDEs.
