# 1. Computer Networks and the Internet

## 1.1 What Is the Internet

​	What is the Internet? There are a couple of ways to answer this question.

​	 First, we can describe the nuts and bolts of the Internet, that is, the basic hardware and software components that make up the Internet. Second, we can describe the Internet in terms of a network-ing infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications. Let’s begin with the nuts-and-bolts description, using Figure 1.1 to illustrate our discussion.

### 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

Figure 1.1 Some pieces of the Internet

​	In Internet jargon, all of these devices are called **hosts** or **end** systems. 

​	End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches. 

​	Links:

* coaxial cable
* copper  wire
* optical  fiber
*  radio  spectrum



​	Different  links  can  transmit data at different rates, with the **transmission rate** of a link measured in bits/second.

​	Packet switches  come  in  many  shapes  and  flavors,  but  the  two  most  prominent  types  in today’s Internet are **routers** and **link-layer switches**.

​	End  systems  access  the Internet  through Internet  Service  Providers  (ISPs), including  residential  ISPs  such  as  local  cable  or  telephone  companies;  corpo-rate  ISPs;  university  ISPs;  ISPs  that  provide  WiFi  access  in  airports,  hotels,  cof-fee shops, and other public places; and cellular data ISPs, providing mobile access to  our  smartphones  and  other  devices

​	The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) are two of the most impor-tant  protocols  in  the  Internet.

​	The  IP  protocol  specifies  the  format  of  the  packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems. The Internet’s principal protocols are collectively known as TCP/IP. 

​	Internet standardsare developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [IETF 2020].The IETF standards  documents  are  called requests  for  comments  (RFCs).

### 1.1.2 A Services Description

​	The applications are said to be distributed applications, since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.

​	End  systems  attached  to  the  Internet  provide  a **socket  interface** that speci-fies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system

### 1.1.3 What Is a Protocol?

**A Human Analogy**

Figure 1.2 A human protocol and a computer network protocol

​	Note that in our human protocol, there are specific messages we send, and  specific  actions  we  take  in  response  to  the  received  reply  messages  or  other events.

**Network Protocols**

​	A network protocol is similar to a human protocol, except that the entities exchang-ing  messages  and  taking  actions  are  hardware  or  software  components  of  some device.

> A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

## 1.2 The Network Edge

​	They are referred to as end systems because they sit at the edge of the Internet, as  shown  in  Figure 1.3.

**Figure 1.3 End-system interaction**

​	End systems are also referred to as hosts because they host (that is, run) appli-cation programs such as a Web browser program, a Web server program, an e-mail client program, or an e-mail server program.

### 1.2.1 Access Networks

​	Having  considered  the  applications  and  end  systems  at  the  “edge  of  the  network,” let’s next consider the access network—the network that physically connects an end system to the first router (also known as the “edge router”) on a path from the end system  to  any  other  distant  end  system.

**Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, and 5G Fixed Wireless**

​	Today,  the  two  most  prevalent  types  of  broadband  residential  access  are **digital  subscriber  line  (DSL)**  and  cable.

**Figure 1.6 A hybrid fiber-coaxial access network**

​	One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a shared broad-cast medium.

**Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): Ethernet and WiFi**

​	On corporate and university campuses, and increasingly in home settings, a local areanetwork (LAN) is used to connect an end system to the edge router. 

​	Ethernet  is  by  far  the  most  preva-lent access technology in corporate, university, and home networks.

Figure 1.8 Ethernet Internet access

​	 Wireless  LAN  access  based  on  IEEE  802.11  technol-ogy, more colloquially known as WiFi, is now just about everywhere—universities, business offices, cafes, airports, homes, and even in airplanes.

**Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE 4G and 5G**

​	Telecommunications  companies  have  made  enormous  investments  in  so-called fourth-generation (4G) wireless, which provides real-world download speeds of up to 60  Mbps.  But  even  higher-speed  wide-area  access  technologies—a  fifth-generation (5G)  of  wide-area  wireless  networks—are  already  being  deployed.  We’ll  cover  the basic principles of wireless networks and mobility, as well as WiFi, 4G and 5G tech-nologies (and more!) in Chapter 7.
